# 🖥️ Portfolio Project: Fractal Visualizations with C++

This project explores the fascinating world of **fractals**, demonstrating how simple mathematical rules can generate intricate and beautiful patterns. Built using **C++** and **graphics.h**, this repository features multiple fractal visualizations, including Julia Sets, Mandelbrot Sets, and Sierpiński Gasket.

📌 **Overview**
This project showcases the following fractals:
- **Sierpiński Gasket** – A self-replicating triangular fractal generated using a midpoint algorithm.
- **Julia Set** – A complex-plane fractal created by iterating over complex numbers.
- **Mandelbrot Set** – A famous fractal that reveals infinite complexity through iterative calculations.

🛠 **Technologies Used**
- **C++** (for mathematical computations and graphics rendering)
- **graphics.h** (for visualizing the fractals)
- **conio.h** (for console-based interactions)
- **cmath** (for mathematical calculations)

📂 **Mathematical Background & Algorithms**
Fractals are generated based on mathematical formulas and iterative processes:
- **Sierpiński Gasket** uses midpoint displacement in a triangle.
- **Julia Set** follows the recursive formula:  
  \( z_{n+1} = z_n^2 + c \)  
  where **c** is a complex constant.
- **Mandelbrot Set** iterates the same equation, but with **c** representing each pixel's complex coordinate.

## ▶️ Running the Project
### 1️⃣ **Installation**
Ensure you have a C++ compiler and **graphics.h** installed:

1. Install a compiler like **MinGW** (for Windows) or **g++** (for Linux/macOS).
2. Install the necessary graphics library for your system.

### 2️⃣ **Compiling and Running the Program**
#### **Windows (Turbo C++ or MinGW)**
```bash
 g++ fractal.cpp -o fractal -lgraphics -lbgi -lgdi32 -lcomdlg32 -luuid -loleaut32 -lole32
 fractal.exe
```

#### **Linux (Using SDL2 for graphics.h replacement)**
```bash
 g++ fractal.cpp -o fractal -lSDL2
 ./fractal
```
